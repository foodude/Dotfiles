# These paths are colon-separated lists, just like regular unix PATH
#
#-----------------------------------------------------------------------------#

# ModulePath is builtin, you may add some directories here
#ModulePath $HOME/mymodules:+

# The default image path is:
#         /usr/include/X11/bitmaps:/usr/include/X11/pixmaps
# if the fvwm_icons are not installed in one of these directories or if
# you want to add a personal image path uncomment and edit the next line
ImagePath :/home/coro/.fvwm/:+

#
#
# * Why doesn't this FAQ contain my question?
# * What are the default bindings?
# * Some (mini-)icons are missing in menus and in some buttons!
# * Does Sample-95 support themes?
# * Can I use Sample-95 with GNOME?
# * How can I load saved settings before starting fvwm?
# * Can I use WindowMaker and AfterStep applets with fvwm?
# * Who wrote this configuration file?
#
# ----------------------------------------------------------------------------
#
# * Why doesn't this FAQ contain my question?
#
# Maybe because the answer is in the beginning of the configuration file
# (i.e., this file!), in the fvwm FAQ or in the fvwm man pages.
#
#                  ----------------------------------------
#
# * What are the default bindings?
#
# Mouse bindings:
# --------------
#
# Mouse 1 on the root window:	 main menu
# Mouse 2 on the root window:	 window operations menu
# Mouse 3 on the root window:	 Window List of all normal applications
# Ctrl-Mouse 3 on the root window: Window List of all skipped applications
#
# Alt-Mouse x inside a window: as Mouse x on the root window
# Shift-Alt-Mouse 3 inside a window: Raise or Lower

# If you have built the config for gnome-session:
# Shift-Mouse x on the root window gives the corresponding "GNOME button"

# Mouse 1 on the title: Raise, Move for a drag, shade for a double click
# Mouse 1 on the borders: Raise, Resize for a drag, shade for a double click
# Mouse 1 on an icon: Move, Raise on one click, deiconify for a double
# Alt-Mouse 1 on an icon; Raise all the icons
# Ctrl-Mouse 1 on the borders: As mouse 1 on the title
# Mouse 2 on the title or the borders: window operations menu
# Mouse 2 on an icon: deiconify
# Mouse 3 on the title/borders: Raise or Lower
# Mouse 3 on an icon: The "modules/icons" window operations menu
#
# Window Buttons:
# --------------
#
# - Left button:
# Mouse 1: Window operation menu, double click: close
# Mouse 2: Group operations menu
# Mouse 3: Quick Move window menu
# - Close button (right button)
# Mouse 1: Close
# Mouse 2: Close all the windows with the same class
# Mouse 3: Destroy

#
# Key bindings (anywhere):
# ------------
#
# Shift-Left/Right/Up/Down: scroll Left/Right/Up/Down by 1 page
# Alt-Left/Right/Up/Down: scroll Left/Right/Up/Down by 1/10 page
#
# Shift-Ctrl-Left/Right/Up/Down: move the pointer by 1O% of a page
# Alt-Ctrl-Left/Right/Up/Down: move the pointer by 1% of a page
#
# Alt-Ctrl-PageUp/PageDown: scroll by one desktop page
#
# Shift-Alt-F1: Main menu
# Shift-Alt-F2: Window operations menu

# Shift-Alt-F11: Identify
# Shift-Alt-F12: Console
#
# Alt-Tab released at once: previous (normal) window
# Alt-Tab: WindowList of all normal windows and warp to the selected window
#	   when released
#
# Ctrl-Alt-Tab: WindowList of all skipped windows
#
# Stroke bindings:
# ---------------
#
# You need to have fvwm compiled with stroke support (these bindings
# are defined only in this case) and libstroke installed.
# Mouse button 3 is used (this button must be pressed during the stroke),
# no modifiers are needed when you start your mouse motion on the root
# window and you must use the Alt modifier if you start your mouse motion
# on a window (you cannot start your motion on a window title bar or frame).
# The mouses motion:
#
# A | from the top to the bottom: your preferred terminal
# A | from the bottom to the top: your prefered editor
# A / from the bottom to the top: your prefered file manager
# A C from the top: xcalc
# A N (from the bottom): netscape
# A clockwise box from the top left: FvwmForm-QuitVerify
#
# Add more yourself!
#
#                  ----------------------------------------
#
# * Some (mini-)icons are missing in menus and in buttons!
#
# If you have no mini(-icons) then either your ImagePath does not contain
# the directory of the fvwm_icons or you are using a RedHat/Mandrake/... rpm
# version of fvwm-icons which uses mini- in the place of mini. for
# mini-icons name. If only some mini(-icons) are missing, then you are using
# a too old version of fvwm_icons.
#
#                  ----------------------------------------
#
# * Does Sample-95 support themes?
#
# No. But, it is possible to hack the configuration to have an "elementary"
# themes engine. The basic idea is to use FvwmTheme to propagate the colors
# and to replace "Read decorations" by "Read theme" in .fvwm2rc where theme
# is a symbolic link to a theme. A theme will be a file which look like
# decorations plus the FvwmTheme configuration commands. Other technical
# functions are needed as a function for switching between themes. This is
# left to your own pleasure! Doing elaborated fvwm configurations is one of
# the better games under UNIX.
#
# If you want a powerful themes engine do not use Sample-95, it is not the
# aim of this configuration. There are a powerful themes engine which is
# under fast development: fvwm-themes (http://fvwm-themes.sourceforge.net/).
#
#
#                  ----------------------------------------
#
# * Can I use Sample-95 with GNOME?
#
# Yes. You "need" fvwm compiled with GNOME support and it is preferable to
# run fvwm under gnome-session. Also, do not forget that you have to set
# FVWM_USERDIR, so start the gnome-session as
#	env FVWM_USERDIR="your FVWM_USERDIR" gnome-session
# Of course, it is preferable to set the "build a file for gnome-session"
# option of the Setup95 script. You may use the option "Try a Stays Put panel"
# to put the panel in the same layer than the normal windows, but you may
# have to leave GNOME/fvwm and start again X to avoid problems.
# Note that under session, Sample-95 does not load your "X settings" by
# default (GNOME has its own method). Moreover, read the next question for
# using a different setting when you use GNOME (you may also use the
# Session(Init/Restart)Function functionality, see the startup file).
# One thing that you can add to your configuration file is:
#	GnomeShowDesk x
# where x is the number of desks you want to see in the GNOME pager at
# start (if not the GNOME pager is dynamic).
# Also, for leaving GNOME you must use GNOME or you must "QuitSession" for
# just exiting or "Exec exec save-session --kill" for saving and exiting.
#
#                  ----------------------------------------
#
# * How can I load saved settings before starting fvwm?
#
# Say, you want to use setting 1 under a normal fvwm session, setting 2
# under a gnome-session and setting 3 under a normal fvwm session but the
# shell test FOO is true. Then, your .xinitrc/.xsession file can look
# as follows (where $1 is the "first" argument given by startx, or by kdm or
# gdm ...).
#
# ...
# case $1 in
#   fvwm)
#	F="your FVWM_USERDIR"
#	if FOO; Then $X="3"; else $X=1; fi;
#	for i in $F/.FvwmAnimate $F/.FvwmForm $F/.fvwm-layers \
#	~/.xinitrc-fvwm $F/.FvwmBaseConfig \ $F/.start-Background \
#	$F/.start-apps-man $F/.start-FvwmButtons $F/.start-DeskerPanelButtons \
#	$F/.start-MiniButtons $F/.start-WinMakerAppButtons \
#	$F/.start-FvwmAnimate $F/.start-FvwmAuto $F/.start-FvwmBanner \
#	$F/.start-FvwmEvent; \
#	 	do /bin/cp $i-$X $i;
#	done;
#	fvwm
#   ;;
#   gnome)
#	F="your FVWM_USERDIR"
#	for i in $F/.FvwmAnimate $F/.FvwmForm $F/.fvwm-layers \
#	~/.xinitrc-fvwm $F/.FvwmBaseConfig \ $F/.start-Background \
#	$F/.start-apps-man $F/.start-FvwmButtons $F/.start-DeskerPanelButtons \
#	$F/.start-MiniButtons $F/.start-WinMakerAppButtons \
#	$F/.start-FvwmAnimate $F/.start-FvwmAuto $F/.start-FvwmBanner \
#	$F/.start-FvwmEvent; \
#		do /bin/cp $i-2 $i;
#	done;
#	env FVWM_USERDIR="your FVWM_USERDIR" gnome-session
#    ;;
#    ... other cases ...
# esac
#
#               ----------------------------------------
#
# * Can I use WindowMaker and AfterStep applets with fvwm?
#
# Yes most WM and AS applets are fvwm compliant. Moreover, sample-95 provides
# a FvwmButtons for you called WinMakerAppButtons. Of course, you have to
# edit the configuration of this buttons to put your preferred applets. Note
# that you have an applets panel under the 3 first applets. These panels are
# special: Mouse 1 (on the background of the applet) start the panel (or only
# map it if it is already started) if it is not out. If the panel is out,
# Mouse 1 unmaps it (but the panel applets are alive). The special thing is
# that Mouse 3 *kills* the panel: this can save your cpu.
#
#                  ----------------------------------------
#
# * Who wrote this configuration file?
#
# The starting point is "the" fvwm95 configuration file. Then, Dominik
# did some work on it and in particular so that it worked fine with
# fvwm-2.3.x.  Later, olicha spent a lot of time with it, wrote the Setup95
# Script and rewrote all the "Settings" stuff. Some ideas came from
# fvwm-themes (thanks to the fvww-themes workers, and in particular migo).
# Probably, some others fvwm-workers have added improvement but did not take
# the time to update this answer.
